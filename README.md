All Your Secret (are Belong to... You)
===================================

A toy app for transmitting secret messages.  
1. Uses [Mark Percival's gibberish-aes library](https://github.com/mdp/gibberish-aes) to encrypt a secret message in the browser and upload the cipher text only.  
2. Store the cipher text in the database along with a random token identifying the message.  
3. Give the user a unique URL where the secret message can be viewed by anyone who also has the original encryption key.  
  
It is fully acknowledged that the 'security' of this app is dubious at best, but it may offer some utility in a limited set of circumstances.
